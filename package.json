  "description": "Detecting polygon self-intersection in Javascript ============================================ An implementation of the O((n + k) log n) Bentleyâ€“Ottmann sweep line algorithm for detecting crossings in a set of line segments. The aim was to make something to speedily detect self-intersecting polygons for client side validation before serialisation and storage, but there's not much to stop it being used serverside (except it being more a statement of intent than actual production ready code).",
